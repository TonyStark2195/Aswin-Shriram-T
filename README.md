Looking forward to a challenging environment that gives generous opportunities for learning and solve real-world problems. Earnestly looking for research positions in your labs.

## PROFILE SUMMARY
- Currently pursuing independent research in association with faculties of School of Computing - Research at SASTRA University
-	3+ years of extensive industrial research experience in building Robotics, Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence systems
-	Demonstrated leadership qualities in a leading IT industry’s R&D division 
-	Bachelor’s in Mechanical with excellent academic records and strong foundations in Robotics and Programming

## RESEARCH & PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE	
### TIGER ANALYTICS : Advanced Analytics & AI	          Feb 2019 – Jul 2019
**Machine Learning Product Engineer & Senior Data Analyst**	
-	Developed Automated ML Modelling pipeline libraries (AutoML & AutoTimeSeries) in Python which uses Evolutionary Algorithms to augment the model performance. This product was deployed in different business sectors like banking, retail,  manufacturing and customer behavior.
-	National level election outcome prediction (2019), using sentiment analysis from tweets (web scraped data using Twitter API) and unsupervised ensemble models in Python.
-	Loss Forecasting modelling (under CECL standards) with credit bureau data for bank’s credit business using R & SAS.
-	Fraud Analytics project: Developed ML models to determine class of frauds with the transaction data of millions of records using PySpark.

### TATA Consultancy Services – IoT Innovation Labs	          Dec 2016 - Jan 2019
**Machine Learning Researcher**
-	Built an AI based Real-Time Predictive Data Analysis application in Python for a Steel Manufacturing Plant (RH Degasser and Ladle Furnace units) with their operational parameters (data like temperature, flow rate of gases, pressure, etc.) to standardize the operating procedures, detect anomalies in operation and suggest the best input parameters to set for efficient production of steel. This resulted in energy conservation and reduction in operation and maintenance cost.
-	Invented a proprietary Generic Time Series Forecasting Engine (algorithm) for Digital Power Plants. This algorithm can handle uncertainty due to the effect of holidays (It had implicit correlation with energy consumption) and unprecedented events. It was used to forecast the demand for power generation and plan the scheduling of the plant accordingly. When deployed it resulted in 87% accuracy on average.
-	Invented another proprietary Ensemble based Meta-Learning Algorithm for Energy Industry leveraging the existing state-of-the-art LSTM, SARIMA, NARX, Res-nets & Evolutionary Algorithms. This module was intended to learn the energy consumption pattern and suggest conservation actions up to individual asset level granularity. When deployed in our IoT product, it resulted in 93% accuracy on average.
-	Created Energy Digital Twin for Commercial facilities. This Industrial IoT (IIoT) product was built using EnergyPlus for modelling the sites and Python ML libraries for predictive analytics, energy optimization and demand forecasting. 
-	Cyber Physical Labs (association with IIT Madras) – Developed Meta-Heuristic modeling algorithm for Chiller Scheduling & Optimization in HVAC systems. A HVAC system contributes from 60% - 80% of energy consumption in a commercial facility, this AI enabled application aided in performance monitoring of the air conditioning systems, improving their efficiency and reducing energy leakage to less than 5%.
^All the above were developed in Python and its ML/DL libraries

### TATA Consultancy Services – General Electric (GE)           Sep 2016 – Nov 2016
**Model Developer & Systems Engineer – GE Digital – Industry 4.0**	
-	3D CAD Modelling & 2D Drafting of High-Speed Research Turbine’s systems and combustion modules using Siemens NX.
-	Developed Predictive Maintenance module for GE Brilliant Factory (IIoT) using ML techniques in Python. This module helps to identify faults and future failures that may occur to a turbine component due to anomalous behavior, and reduce the downtime of a plant. It also provides detailed diagnostics on components and their health statistics.

### TATA Consultancy Services – New Product Development Lab	          Jun 2016 – Aug 2016
**NPD Engineer – Trainee (Engineering & Industrial Services)**
-	Designed, Developed & Fabricated 3D printer (3 DOF - PPP configuration) and SCARA parallel manipulator (3 DOF – PRR configuration). Lead the teams for the above two projects.
-	Collaborated with COE team (Additive Manufacturing Lab) for research on Design and Structural analysis of the developed Robotic systems.
-	Built Assembly line automation prototype using Lego Robotics Toolkit and their modular programming software.
