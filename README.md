### TATA Consultancy Services – IoT Innovation Labs <object align = "right"> Dec 2016 - Jan 2019 </object>
**Machine Learning Researcher**
-	Built an AI based Real-Time Predictive Data Analysis application in Python for a Steel Manufacturing Plant (RH Degasser and Ladle Furnace units) with their operational parameters (data like temperature, flow rate of gases, pressure, etc.) to standardize the operating procedures, detect anomalies in operation and suggest the best input parameters to set for efficient production of steel. This resulted in energy conservation and reduction in operation and maintenance cost.
-	Invented a proprietary Generic Time Series Forecasting Engine (algorithm) for Digital Power Plants. This algorithm can handle uncertainty due to the effect of holidays (It had implicit correlation with energy consumption) and unprecedented events. It was used to forecast the demand for power generation and plan the scheduling of the plant accordingly. When deployed it resulted in 87% accuracy on average.
-	Invented another proprietary Ensemble based Meta-Learning Algorithm for Energy Industry leveraging the existing state-of-the-art LSTM, SARIMA, NARX, Res-nets & Evolutionary Algorithms. This module was intended to learn the energy consumption pattern and suggest conservation actions up to individual asset level granularity. When deployed in our IoT product, it resulted in 93% accuracy on average.
-	Created Energy Digital Twin for Commercial facilities. This Industrial IoT (IIoT) product was built using EnergyPlus for modelling the sites and Python ML libraries for predictive analytics, energy optimization and demand forecasting. 
-	Cyber Physical Labs (association with IIT Madras) – Developed Meta-Heuristic modeling algorithm for Chiller Scheduling & Optimization in HVAC systems. A HVAC system contributes from 60% - 80% of energy consumption in a commercial facility, this AI enabled application aided in performance monitoring of the air conditioning systems, improving their efficiency and reducing energy leakage to less than 5%.
^All the above were developed in Python and its ML/DL libraries
